# Krakbone Boilerplate
Krakbone is a template for quickly sketching single-page web-apps.
Included is most everything you would need to create a web-app prototype.
It is rendered with dust and backbone on the front-end to create easily understandable
web-views, and is powered by kraken's express framework for an easily configurable
middle/meddle-ware backend.
